# Ensure Bullet Point Consistency

Ensure all bullet point lists use consistent capitalization and punctuation.

Each list item should:
1. Start with a capital letter
2. End with a period if it's a complete sentence
3. Not have a period if it's a phrase or incomplete sentence
4. Maintain parallel structure (all items should be the same grammatical form)

Apply this rule to all bullet point lists in the document.
