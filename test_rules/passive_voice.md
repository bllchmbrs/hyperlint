# Convert Passive Voice to Active Voice

Find instances of passive voice in the document and convert them to active voice. 
Focus particularly on phrases like "is being done", "was performed", "has been completed", etc.
Convert them to their active equivalents.

For example:
- "The test is being performed" → "We are performing the test"
- "The data was analyzed" → "We analyzed the data"
- "The code has been reviewed" → "The team reviewed the code"

Only change sentences that would be clearer in active voice.
