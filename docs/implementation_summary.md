# Configuration Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive configuration system and a new unified `edit` command to EditAI. The system allows users to configure all editors through a single YAML file and run multiple editors in a single operation, either in parallel or sequentially.

## Components Implemented

1. **Configuration System**
   - Simple YAML-based configuration format
   - Support for default configuration locations
   - Editor-specific configuration sections
   - Global settings (recursive, dry-run, etc.)
   - Configuration loading and validation

2. **New `edit` Command**
   - Unified command to run multiple editors
   - Support for including/excluding specific editors
   - Parallel editor execution for improved performance
   - Comprehensive summary output

3. **Configuration Management Commands**
   - `config init`: Create a default configuration file
   - `config show`: Display current configuration
   - `config validate`: Validate configuration file

4. **New Utility Functions**
   - `guess_image_folder`: Intelligently find image directories
   - Enhanced editor configuration processing

5. **Comprehensive Tests**
   - Unit tests for configuration classes and functions
   - Integration tests for CLI commands
   - Test fixtures and mock objects

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Single command to run multiple editors
   - Consistent configuration across all editors
   - Simplified workflow with sensible defaults

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Parallel editor execution
   - Shared configuration reduces startup overhead

3. **Maintainability Improvements**
   - Centralized configuration management
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easier to extend with new editors

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with new features
   - Detailed configuration documentation
   - Example configuration files

## Next Steps

1. **Additional Enhancements**
   - Add environment variable support for configuration
   - Add support for merging multiple configuration files
   - Implement per-directory configuration

2. **Integration with Existing Commands**
   - Update individual editor commands to use the configuration system
   - Add backward compatibility layer

3. **IDE Integration**
   - Add VS Code extension support
   - Add support for editor-specific configuration via comments
