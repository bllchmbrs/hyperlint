# MDX Test File

import { Button } from './components/Button'
import { Alert } from '@/components/Alert'

This is a standard markdown paragraph that should be linted normally.

<Button variant="primary" onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>
  Click me
</Button>

## Another Section

Here's some more markdown content with issues that should be caught by linting.

<Alert type="warning">
  This is an alert component with some content.
  It spans multiple lines and should be protected from linting.
</Alert>

The following sentence has passive voice and should be detected: "The button was clicked by the user."

```javascript
// This code block should be ignored by most linters
const example = () => {
  return <div>Hello World</div>
}
```

<CustomComponent
  prop1="value1"
  prop2={someVariable}
  onCustomEvent={(data) => handleEvent(data)}
>
  <NestedComponent />
  <p>This paragraph is inside a component and should be protected</p>
</CustomComponent>

Final paragraph that should be linted normally.

export { CustomComponent }
